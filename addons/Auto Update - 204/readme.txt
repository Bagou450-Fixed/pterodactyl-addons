Hey, thanks for your purchase.

For install PANEL Auto-Update upload the panel.sh file on your server and execute it with bash (exemple if you upload it in /root/ execute bash /root/panel.sh).
And in crontab (for open crontab use crontab -e) enter "0 0 * * * /bin/bash /etc/pteroautoupdatepanel.sh >/dev/null 2>&1"
